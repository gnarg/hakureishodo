# What is Shodo?
Shodo is the art of writing Japanese characters on paper using a brush, ink, and paper, and expressing oneself through the characters and typeface. Shodo requires concentration and mastery of the art of writing beautiful characters, so it is also a form of spiritual discipline and training. Shuji, or penmanship, is a preliminary step to shodo.
